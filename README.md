This project is a playlist collaboration PWA for HCDD340 created by Eden De La Cruz, Ashley Santana, and Henry Adams. 

The current features that work in this project are: 
- Dynamic song searching
- User creation and saving usernames to local storage.
- User status updating on the user creation and profile page.
- Updating the activity feed on the home page every time a user "adds" a song to a playlist using the plus buttons on a song in the search song page.
- Clickable navigation bar buttons
- Libraries > Kpop Playlist, to view an example of what a playlist would look like
